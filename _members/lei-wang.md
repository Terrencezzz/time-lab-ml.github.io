Lei Wang is an ARC Hub Research Fellow (Grade 2) in the School of Engineering and Built Environment — Electrical and Electronic Engineering at Griffith University, working under the guidance of Prof. Yongsheng Gao (Griffith University) and Prof. Piotr Koniusz (Data61/CSIRO & ANU & UNSW). He is also a Visiting Scientist at Data61/CSIRO. He originally founded the Temporal Intelligence and Motion Extraction (TIME) Lab at ANU, leading a dynamic team of master’s and honours students in machine learning and computer vision research. The lab has since transitioned to the ARC Research Hub at Griffith University, where it is now an integral part of the Hub and the broader Griffith research community.

Previously, he was a Research Fellow (Level B) in the School of Computing at the ANU College of Engineering, Computing, and Cybernetics, working with Assoc. Prof. Liang Zheng (ANU) and Prof. Tom Gedeon (Curtin University). He also served as a Visiting Scientist in the Machine Learning Research Group (MLRG) at Data61/CSIRO. During this period, he successfully supervised three master’s and three honours students on their final-year research projects at the TIME Lab, mentoring them in high-quality research. Some of their work was published in top-tier machine learning conferences, such as NeurIPS, ICLR, and ICML.

Since 2018, he has worked as a full-time Computer Vision Researcher at iCetana Pty Ltd in Perth. He has also held Visiting Researcher positions at MLRG, Data61/CSIRO, and the Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering at The University of Western Australia (UWA). In 2021, he joined Active Intelligence Australia Pty Ltd as a Computer Scientist, leading research and development in commercial anomaly detection solutions. His project successfully secured $1.2 million USD in funding, earning him the Incentive Unit Award.

Before pursuing his PhD at ANU and Data61/CSIRO, Lei received several prestigious PhD scholarships, including the ARC Industrial Transformation Training Centre Scholarship, UWA International Fee Scholarship, University Postgraduate Award, Data61 PhD Scholarship, Data61 Top-up Scholarship, and ANU HDR Fee Remission Merit Scholarship. During his PhD, he authored multiple first-author papers published in top-tier venues such as CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, ACM MM, TPAMI, IJCV, and TIP. His research, supervised by Prof. Piotr Koniusz (Data61/CSIRO & ANU & UNSW), earned him the Sang Uk Lee Best Student Paper Award at ACCV 2022.

His research interests include action recognition in videos, anomaly detection, video and image processing, one- and few-shot learning, deep learning, tensor learning, and domain adaptation.
