Hi, I‚Äôm Xi Ding! I‚Äôm currently a Master‚Äôs student in Computing (Machine Learning) at the Australian National University (ANU) üéì. My academic and research journey specializes in video processing and artificial intelligence, with a focus on making machines better at understanding videos in practical and transparent ways. I‚Äôm currently a Research Assistant at the TIME Lab ‚è≥, working alongside talented researchers to push the boundaries of video understanding. Additionally, I am an ARC Hub Scholar at TIME üíª, hosted at Griffith University.

My work centers on key areas like action recognition (teaching machines to identify actions in videos, such as walking or playing sports), video anomaly detection (spotting unusual events in footage), and multimodal learning (combining video, text, and other data for smarter AI). I‚Äôve published several first-author papers, including two oral presentations at the Companion Proceedings of The ACM Web Conference (WWW 2025). My research aims to not only improve accuracy but also make AI more interpretable‚Äîsomething I believe is crucial for real-world applications.

Before diving into computing, I earned a Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Economics from China Agricultural University and the University of Colorado Denver (2019‚Äì2023). There, I honed my skills in data analysis through courses like Statistics, Econometrics, and Numerical Analysis. This foundation in economics gave me a unique perspective on problem-solving, which I now apply to machine learning and computer vision challenges.

Beyond research, I‚Äôm passionate about contributing to the academic community. I‚Äôm currently a Workshop Coordinator for WWW 2025, where I‚Äôm organizing the 1st International Workshop on Transformative Insights in Multi-faceted Evaluation. This role lets me connect with researchers worldwide, and foster discussions on innovative web technologies.

My professional experience includes internships that shaped my technical and collaborative skills. At Qingdao Aerospace Power Research Institute (2023‚Äì2024), I worked on the Digital Twin Project, building web interfaces and digital models to improve aerospace simulations. Earlier, at CNMC Trading Co., Ltd (2021), I managed logistics and solved real-time shipping challenges, learning how to think on my feet and work with diverse teams.

I‚Äôve also contributed to hands-on projects that blend creativity and technology. For example, my Active Vision project (2024‚Äì2025) uses machine learning to analyze tennis swings in real time, helping players improve their technique with instant feedback. Another project, Image Embedding Explorer (2024), is an interactive tool that makes complex image data easier to understand by visualizing it in 3D. These experiences reflect my drive to build tools that are both innovative and practical.

Beyond my research, I‚Äôm passionate about sportsüèÄ, musicüé∏, and travel‚úàÔ∏è. I love playing basketball and badminton, always enjoying the challenge and energy they bring. Exploring new places around the world excites me, as I love experiencing different cultures and perspectives. Music is another big part of my life. I enjoy playing the guitar and have a deep appreciation for country music, which never fails to inspire me. These passions keep me balanced, creative, and always curious about the world.
